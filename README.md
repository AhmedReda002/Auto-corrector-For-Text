##  Auto-Corrector:  

This project implements a basic auto-corrector for text using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It utilizes common text processing methods and a provided dataset to suggest corrections for misspelled words, enhancing the accuracy of written text.


##  Features

* **Text Processing:**  Splits text into words and performs basic pre-processing for analysis.
* **Error Detection:** Utilizes regular expressions (`re`) to identify potential misspellings.
* **Correction Suggestions:**  Generates possible corrections for misspelled words based on the provided dataset and text analysis techniques (e.g., deleting a letter, switching letters, replacing words).
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a straightforward way for users to input text and receive suggested corrections.


##  Requirements

* **Python 3.x:**  This project is written in Python. Make sure you have Python 3 installed. 
* **Required Libraries:** 
    * `re`: For regular expression matching (pattern recognition).
    * **(Optional):** Libraries like `nltk`, `spacy`, or `gensim` can be used for more advanced NLP techniques and larger datasets.

## Usage
Prepare Your Dataset: You'll need a dataset of correctly spelled words to train your auto-corrector. You can use a dictionary file, a list of words, or create your own dataset.
Run the Script: Execute the auto_corrector.py script (or the name of your main script file).
Input Text: Enter the text you want to be corrected.
View Suggestions: The script will analyze the text and display suggested corrections for any misspelled words it identifies.

## Example
### Input Text:
"opeq."

### Output:
The best suggestion for the word " opeq "are:
['hope', 'open', 'over', 'one']
